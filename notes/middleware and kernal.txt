##Middleware

-Middleware are functions that run before the request hits the router.
-The handle() method contains the main logic of the middleware, while the terminate() method contains the “clean up” logic just before the app is shut down.
-The Kernel is responsible to pass the request to the router through middleware.
-The Kernel bootstraps the application by setting up:
            *Environment Variable
            *Configuration
            *Exception Handling
            *Register facade and Service Provider
