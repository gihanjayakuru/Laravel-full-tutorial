##Service Providers

    -Service Providers are classes that instruct Laravel on how to instantiate a service class.
    -The register() method is where you define your class binding.
    -The boot() method is called after all Services are registered.
    -We need to put our Service Provider in the ‘provider’ array in the app config file to activate it. Otherwise, Laravel will ignore it.
    -The Service can resolve using the ‘Automatic Resolution’ features.
